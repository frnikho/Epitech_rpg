Map:
    The editor Tiled was used to create these maps:
        - overworld
        - topaze village
        - boss dungeon
    Tiled create a json file that contains as many layers as 
    you want with these infos:
        - id
        - array of tiles id, like [183, 181, 184, 183, 57, 57, 57, 57]
        - dimentions
        - name
    Moreover, you can add object in tiled such as 
    {x, y, width, height}, this was used to create 
    the collisions of the maps.

    During the loading of the map, the parser pick 
    the tiles dimension in Tiled's json and cut out the 
    tileset and set ids. The the map is load from the tiles ids array.

NPCs:
    To create an npc we need 3 things:
    
    - The template, for the sprite animation. 
                    (Coordinates in the npcs.png)
    - The Location, every places of the world have a location in location.json were
                    is listed all the npcs of the place with there behaviour.
    - The dialog, in the dialog.json were is stocked every dialogs such as : 
                  {"farmer":"Hello world !"} with keycodes for interpretation 
                  ('#' for a new page, '$' for new line).
